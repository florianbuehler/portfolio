Wanting to learn Next.js for some time, I followed the official tutorial, watched one or two more, and then practiced by creating this **_Dip Finder_**. The **_Dip Finder_** helps you to track a watchlist and to find stocks which are cheap with respect to the 200 days moving average. 

The application uses Firebase Auth to provide different authentication methods and Firestore to persist the data.
