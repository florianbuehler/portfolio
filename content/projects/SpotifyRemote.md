Wanting to learn Next.js for some time, I followed the official tutorial, watched one or two more, and then practiced by creating this **_Spotify Remote_**, which let's you authenticate via Spotify OAuth, and watch and control your Spotify playlists.

**Note:** Since the Spotify API is not a dedicated player, and only allows remote control, an active device (e.g. the Spotify app on your phone or browser) needs to be open for the app to work.
